            <p class="subhead">The bene ts and risks of a well-planned borrowing strategy</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Leverage is a powerful but often underutilized way to enhance an investment portfolio that can help you:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Meet a wide variety of investment objectives within risk parameters you nd acceptable</li>
                        <li>Increase your potential for enhanced returns, while managing risks, and without having to alter your asset allocation</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>In today’s low rate environment, a nancing strategy may serve as a cost-e ective overlay to the strategic asset allocation that is the bedrock of your portfolio</li>
                <li>It’s important to be mindful of the risks associated with leverage, which can magnify gains as well as losses</li>

            <h2>In today’s fast-changing investment landscape, deploying borrowed capital can help you pursue higher returns or meet other investment objectives.</h2>
            <p>Preserving and growing wealth involves risk. At J.P. Morgan, we aim to help our clients take on the right type of risk. This requires a dynamic approach to investing that is continuously re ned as markets and macroeconomic conditions change. As a result, our views of what constitutes the most e cient means of implementation change to accommodate tactical or longer-term strategic considerations.</p>
            <p>Given today’s low cost of borrowing, adding capital through modest leverage to an overall investment portfolio—or, for that matter, to selective investments—may be compelling.1</p>
            <p>A good way to assess the potential bene ts of a leverage strategy is to undertake a holistic review of your investment objectives. This will help you see how borrowing can optimally be integrated into your nancial plans.</p>
            <h3> For more information</h3>
            <p> Your J.P. Morgan team, including your dedicated investment and credit specialists, can help you evaluate your liquidity needs and tailor an appropriate nancing structure. It also can provide a wide range of leverage and investment ideas beyond the ones outlined in this paper.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Borrowing to enhance portfolio returns</h3>
            <p>Often, when investors seek higher portfolio returns, they adjust their asset allocation to take on more market risk. Careful analysis, however, might reveal that adding leverage to your portfolio is more appropriate to your circumstances: This powerful— but often overlooked—strategy can help you enhance returns and maintain your current asset allocation without selling assets or introducing portfolio turnover.</p>
            <p>As with other return-enhancing moves, adding leverage brings on additional risks. Determining if this is the right course for your portfolio depends on the cost of borrowing, your outlook on markets, your tolerance for risk, and your near- and longer-term nancial goals.</p>
            <p>For example, an entrepreneur, whose wealth was concentrated in several private businesses, worked with J.P. Morgan to manage a pool of liquid assets in a Balanced portfolio with moderate risk and return objectives. This approach re ected her uncertain outlook on markets as well as her unwillingness to take on too much risk.2</p>
            <p>Her views on the economy began to change, however, after she sold one of her businesses and her balance sheet became more liquid. At that point, she was willing to accept slightly more risk in her portfolio— as long as it did not trigger a change to her overall risk pro le.</p>
            <p>Initially, she thought to increase her allocation to equities, as this had the potential to enhance her returns. After consulting with her J.P. Morgan team, she opted to continue investing in a Balanced portfolio and to add risk via modest borrowing—a strategy that could potentially provide an equity-like increase in return but with a lesser degree of volatility.</p>
            <h4>Effiency and e ectiveness</h4>
            <p>Market dynamics typically dictate that higher returns come with less risk e ciency. That is, increasing a portfolio’s potential return usually results in a higher risk per unit of return, thereby reducing its Sharpe ratio3 (see table, page 5). This is also true of leveraged portfolios.</p>
            <p>Based on our analysis, we believe that when the cost of borrowing is low enough, as it is today, volatility increases at a slower rate for each unit of return. As a result, the decline in the Sharpe ratio is typically less pronounced. Thus, adding leverage can be a more e cient way to increase a portfolio’s return potential without altering its current asset allocation mix and the corresponding diversi cation bene ts of its asset class combinations. In contrast, moving up the risk spectrum via asset allocation changes—achieved by allocating to riskier assets—may not be desirable for clients comfortable with their current asset allocation mix.</p>

        <section>
            <h4>Risk and return potential</h4>
            <p>With markets today steadily improving, incorporating a nancing strategy into an investment portfolio may be a more e cient way to increase the potential for return per unit of risk than altering your portfolio’s asset allocation. This strategy can be particularly e cient when borrowing costs are low—but it is not the only time to consider such a strategy.</p>
            <p>At J.P. Morgan, we believe that nancing strategies can be e ectively implemented and adjusted in all market cycles: We view nancing as a tactical strategy, with borrowing amounts dialed up or down depending on the prevailing market environment and your own personal situation. Moreover, our recommendations assume you will eventually want to reduce the amount of borrowed capital you employ to manage risk and maintain a well-balanced asset allocation.</p>
            <h4>Risk considerations</h4>
            <p>Portfolios with leverage have greater exposure to tail events, market upswings and declines; they also have exposure to risks speci c to borrowing, including interest rate risk and margin calls. If you are to achieve your nancial objectives, you must be able to stay invested following a large market downturn in order to fully participate in a market recovery. This means avoiding margin calls that can force you out of the market and impede your ability to participate in a rally to the same degree as when the market declined. To “capture” recoveries, such as the one following the credit crisis of 2008, you must be able to withstand the stepped-up volatility a nancing strategy induces in a portfolio.

To “capture” recoveries, such as the one following the credit crisis of 2008, you must be able to withstand the stepped-up volatility a nancing strategy induces in a portfolio.
            </p>
            <h4>The importance of modest leverage</h4>
            <p>A modest approach to leverage allows you to potentially enhance returns, while maintaining a wide bu er to minimize the probability of a margin call. Extensive scenario analysis of the J.P. Morgan model portfolios indicates that borrowing levels of 30% or less have a very low probability of a margin call.4,5 Given the high volatility of the Aggressive Growth portfolio, we recommend limiting borrowing levels to 10%. The market crises and turbulence of the 2000’s provide excellent stress tests for leveraged investments.</p>
            <p>At the market peak in February 2007, for example, adding 30% leverage to our Conservative, Balanced and Growth portfolios would have allowed them to weather the market lows of the credit crisis a year later. The three portfolios would have experienced losses of 27%, 41% and 54%, respectively, but without incurring signi cant risk of a margin call. The same is true for the Aggressive Growth portfolio with 10% leverage, which would have incurred a loss of 55% in the same period. With an advance rate of 65%, these borrowing levels would have had a signi cantly large cushion— enough to sustain a total loss of 64.5% before a margin call was triggered.</p>
            <p>Typically, when investment nancing at the portfolio level exceeds 30%, it produces risk characteristics similar to those of portfolios at the next higher risk pro le (see table below). Thus, marginal return enhancements for levered portfolios should be weighed against the risk of margin calls, as well as related borrowing costs, also highlighted in the table. For some investors, the increased risk/reward potential associated with a more aggressive approach may be acceptable. However, in general, if you wish to move to the next risk pro le, we recommend reallocating to the next model portfolio to achieve a diversi ed, long-term asset allocation without these additional risks.</p>
        </section>

            <h4>Impact on portfolio value</h4>
            <p>The chart below (left) illustrates the total loss of invested capital (portfolio return after all debt is repaid) that would have occurred during the recent credit crisis. It also shows how, when nancing exceeds the recommended maximum borrowing level, the risk pro le is similar to that of the next model portfolio. The chart on the right shows the upside potential that modest leverage could have o ered during the recent recovery period following the credit crisis. The two charts together illustrate the importance of remaining invested in varying market cycles.</p>
            <p>Before adding a modest amount of leverage to an existing portfolio, it is also helpful to consider the potential impact it may have on the value of your portfolio over the course of your investment timeframe.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="call-out">
            <h4>How much leverage is appropriate?</h4>
            <p>Fundamentally, the amount you borrow should always be tailored to your personal circumstances, nancial objectives and risk tolerance. However, as a general rule, we believe a nancing strategy for the portfolio should be limited to a maximum of 30% for Conservative, Balanced and Growth risk pro les, and 10% for Aggressive Growth portfolios. That is, leverage should not be of so great an amount that it moves you from one risk pro le to the next.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="chart"></section>
        <section class="chart"></section>
        <section>
            <p>The chart above shows how varying leverage levels— and their associated borrowing costs—a ect the expected risk and return within each of the model portfolios. The top line of each cone represents a hypothetical borrowing cost of cash (set to our long-term expectation of 2.00%). Along this line, the three portfolios each have the same Sharpe ratio as portfolios with no leverage (0%). The shaded regions show that the likelihood of higher returns is degraded as nancing costs increase: The bottom line of the cone illustrates that, when borrowing costs are high, taking on more risk may not, in fact, improve returns. The middle line within the cone represents a borrowing rate of 3.50% (cash + 1.50%), which is closer to the current low-cost environment and gives rise to higher expected returns when leverage is applied.</p>
            <p>Clearly, borrowing costs can substantially impact the risk-return pro le of a portfolio: Adding leverage can enhance the likelihood of higher returns within an investor’s current asset allocation and risk pro le— without having to move to a completely di erent type of portfolio.</p>
            <h4>Potential bene ts of a leverage strategy</h4>
            <p>Modest borrowing can be a more e cient strategy for increasing market exposure and enhancing returns than altering a core asset allocation. As such, it can be viewed as a strategic complement to your investment portfolio. However, as explained above, a leverage strategy should not be undertaken without careful analysis of the potential rewards and risks—and a full understanding of how it can help you achieve your investment goals.
            </p>
            <p>If you envision making a permanent and strategic change to your risk-return pro le, we recommend altering your asset allocation—unless the volatility and returns you are targeting are greater than our Growth model portfolio.</p>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>Aim to meet a range of goals with leverage</h3>
            <p>Borrowing can o er distinctive bene ts—both in the near term and for longer periods—beyond helping you enhance investment return and growing your overall portfolio:</p>
            <h4>Fund timely investment opportunities</h4>
            <p>Looking at both sides of your balance sheet can help you identify potential cost savings and funding sources, allowing you to quickly deploy capital when tactical investment opportunities arise.</p>
            <p>Example: A sophisticated investor avidly sought opportunities to take advantage of market pullbacks triggered by headline risks. Typically, he funded such investments by liquidating other portions of his portfolio. Seeing opportunity in the recovering U.S. housing market—but being fully invested in high-conviction strategies he did not wish to sell—he reviewed his options with his J.P. Morgan team. His decision: raise short-term capital by borrowing against existing holdings. By identifying the amount of nancing he required and borrowing only a modest amount (leaving a bu er to protect against market uctuation), he had funds to seize an opportunity without adding signi cant risk to his portfolio.6</p>
            <h4>Gain liquidity and remain invested</h4>
            <p>Often, when investors need liquidity their rst thought is to sell or liquidate assets. Setting up a line of credit against diversi ed marketable securities, after reviewing the associated risks, may be an e ective strategy: You retain the assets and gain immediate access to funding to meet unforeseen expenses, satisfy taxes or manage other nancial obligations.</p>
            <p>Example: The head of a family o ce managed a diversi ed portfolio of liquid and non-liquid assets: marketable securities, residential real estate, artwork and an aircraft. Historically, he had never employed a borrowing strategy, although cash ows were often constrained at various times of the year, requiring family members to cover any funding gaps. This problem was then exacerbated by the retirement of a family member. Rather than liquidate a portion of the investment portfolio the family o ce head had e ciently created with the aid of J.P. Morgan, he opted to establish a credit line using the investment portfolio as collateral (see chart, page 9). This allowed him to use credit line proceeds to cover family members’ lifestyle expenses and to fund new investment opportunities, e ectively covering the family’s cash ow needs.6</p>
        </section>
        <section class="chart"></section>
        <section>
            <p>The example above illustrates the value of using a line of credit to remain invested rather than liquidating a portion of a portfolio. The hypothetical total return scenario is based on a Balanced portfolio, and the return is calculated algebraically based on the hypothetical total portfolio return, total investment (including loan amount) and loan cost. The total portfolio return is 6.25%, and the total loan cost is 1.75% (3-month LIBOR + 150 bps).</p>
            <h4>Diversify holdings</h4>
            <p>Having a concentrated position in a single asset holds a distinct set of risks for most investors. One way to mitigate this exposure is to borrow against the asset: This allows you to retain ownership—and opportunities for appreciation—while providing a source of funds for other investments.</p>
            <p>Example: A client wanted to take advantage of a new venture opportunity, largely because it would allow him to better diversify his holdings over the next few years. His dilemma: He did not have enough cash on hand to fund the venture outright, but he did not want to gain liquidity by selling any of his other investments. Working with his J.P. Morgan team, he decided that his best option was to establish a line of credit against his investment portfolio. The attractive nancing terms of this arrangement allowed him to fund the new venture and meet his diversi cation objectives.7</p>

            <h5>UNDERSTANDING LONG-TERM ESTIMATES</h5>
            <p>
                Our investment management research incorporates our proprietary projections of the expected returns and volatility of each asset class over the long term, as well as estimates of the correlations among asset classes. Clearly, nancial rms cannot predict how markets will perform in the future. But we do believe that by analyzing current economic and market conditions and historical market trends, and then, most critically, making projections of future economic growth, in ation and real yields for each country, we can estimate the long-term performance for an entire asset class, given current and our estimated equilibrium levels. The “equilibrium” level shows the average or central tendency of a market or macroeconomic variable such as yield or credit spread that is expected to prevail over the long term, because the level represents the value inherent in a given market. The return assumptions are based on our proprietary process of using a building block approach for each of the asset classes. For instance, the building blocks for equity consist of our projections for revenue and margin growth, dividend yield and buybacks, and change in valuations. The building blocks for xed income consist of our projections for future yields and the change in bond prices. The estimates for alternatives are driven by our historical analysis and judgment about the relationship to public markets. It is possible—indeed, probable—that actual returns will vary considerably from this expectation, even for a number of years. But we believe that market returns will always at some point return to the equilibrium trend. We further believe that these kinds of forward-looking assessments are far more accurate than historical trends in deciding what asset class performance will be, and how best to determine an optimal asset mix.</p>
            <p>In reviewing this material, please understand that all references to expected return are not promises, or even estimates, of actual returns one may achieve. The assumptions are not based on speci c products and do not re ect fees, such as investment management fees, oversight fees, transaction costs or other expenses that could reduce return. They simply show what the long-term return should be, according to our best estimates of current and equilibrium conditions. Also note that actual performance may be a ected by the expertise of the person who actually manages these investments, both in picking individual securities and possibly adjusting the mix periodically to take advantage of asset class undervaluations and overvaluations caused by market trends.</p>
            <p>For the purpose of this analysis volatility is de ned as a statistical measure of the dispersion of return for a given allocation and is measured as the standard deviation of the allocation’s arithmetic return. The Sharpe ratio is a return/risk measure, where the return (the numerator) is de ned as the incremental annual return of an investment over the risk-free rate. Risk (the denominator) is de ned as the standard deviation (volatility) of the allocation’s return less the risk-free rate. The risk-free rate utilized is J.P. Morgan’s long-term assumption for Cash. Correlation is a statistical measure of the degree to which the movements of two variables, in this case asset class returns, are related. Correlation can range from -1 to 1, with 1 indicating that the returns of two assets move directionally in concert with one another (i.e., they behave in the same way during the same time). A correlation of 0 indicates that the returns move independently of each other, and -1 indicates that they move in the opposite direction.</p>

Fees vary considerably according to the client and nature and size of the portfolio.</p>
            <p>
                In association with this presentation, a number of factors should be noted in relation to the risks associated with investment management risks, market crisis and governmental intervention, regulatory change risk, emerging and developing markets, funding liquidity and market trading risks.</p>
            <p>Leverage as a return-enhancement strategy: As a tactical investment strategy, leverage may be dialed up or down over time, according to market conditions. A leveraged investment strategy is relatively attractive in a low interest rate environment when the cost of borrowing is modest, though using leverage in a rising-rate environment may also be e ective at an appropriate level. However, even in a low-rate environment, not all investments are suitable leverage candidates. Generally, we recommend you consider adding leverage to those investments with lower price volatility and higher liquidity levels.</p>
            <p>Leverage may add risk to a portfolio. Adding leverage to an investment can magnify gains as well as losses. Please consider the following:
            </p>
            <p>Margin calls J.P. Morgan establishes a maximum loan-to-value ratio for investments (i.e., the maximum amount of a loan collateralized by that nancial investment). If the market declines, and the value of the underlying asset moves lower than the lending value required to support the loan, J.P. Morgan will request additional funds to maintain the required lending value amount. A “margin call” requirement can be met either with cash or additional securities. In exercising its remedies, J.P. Morgan will not be required to marshal assets or act in accordance with any duciary duty it otherwise might have.</p>
            <p>Increased collateral requirements At any time, and without prior written notice, J.P. Morgan can decrease the advance rate for an investment securing a loan, thereby triggering a margin call. Loans collateralized by securities involve certain risks and may not be suitable for all investors. If the market declines, you may be required to deposit additional securities and/or cash into your account.</p>
            <p>Sale of securities In the event that a margin call is not met, J.P. Morgan has the right to sell securities held in the accounts to satisfy the obligation, as well as the right to decide which assets to sell. J.P. Morgan will attempt to notify a client before a collateral sale is made. However, we are not required to do so. Some or all of the securities sold to meet a margin/maintenance call may be sold at prices higher than their initial cost, which may result in adverse tax consequences. You should consult your tax advisor in order to fully understand the tax implications associated with pledging securities in connection with a margin loan. Please read your Customer Agreement carefully so that you understand your obligations.</p>
            <p>Higher borrowing costs Borrowing costs may increase over time if short-term interest rates move higher</p>
            <h5>IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT YOUR INVESTMENTS AND POTENTIAL CONFLICTS OF INTEREST</h5>
            <p>Con icts of interest may arise whenever JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or any of its a liates (together, “J.P. Morgan”) have an actual or perceived economic or other incentive in J.P. Morgan’s management of its clients’ portfolios to act in a way that bene ts J.P. Morgan. Con icts may result, for example (to the extent the following activities are permitted in your account): (1) when J.P. Morgan invests in an investment product, such as a mutual fund, structured product, separately managed account or hedge fund issued or managed by JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. or an a liate, such as J.P. Morgan Investment Management Inc.; (2) when a J.P. Morgan entity obtains services, including trade execution and trade clearing, from an a liate such as J.P. Morgan Securities LLC or J.P. Morgan Clearing Corp.; (3) when J.P. Morgan receives payment as a result of purchasing an investment product for a client’s account; or (4) when J.P. Morgan receives payment for providing services (including shareholder servicing, record keeping or custody) with respect to investment products purchased for a client’s portfolio. Other con icts may result because of relationships that J.P. Morgan has with other clients or when J.P. Morgan acts for its own account.</p>
            <p>Prospective investment strategies are carefully selected from both J.P. Morgan and third-party asset managers across the industry and are subject to a rigorous and ongoing review process that is consistently applied by our manager research teams. Recommended strategies are then subject to investment committee review and approval.
            </p>
            <p>From the approved pool of strategies, our portfolio construction teams select those strategies we believe best t our asset allocation goals and forward- looking views in order to meet the portfolio’s investment objective. As a general matter, J.P. Morgan provides restricted advice, as we prefer J.P. Morgan managed strategies unless we think-third party managers o er substantially di erentiated portfolio construction bene ts. Consequently, we expect the proportion of J.P. Morgan managed strategies will be high (in fact, up to 100%) in strategies such as, for example, cash and high-quality xed income, subject to applicable law and any account-speci c considerations.</p>
            <p>We prefer internally managed strategies because they generally align well with our forward-looking views and our familiarity with the investment processes, as well as the risk and compliance philosophy that comes from being part of the same rm. It is important to note that J.P. Morgan receives more overall fees when internally managed strategies are included.</p>
            <h5>ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</h5>
            <p>Please note that lines of credit are extended at the discretion of J.P. Morgan, and J.P. Morgan has no commitment to extend a line of credit or make loans available under the line of credit. Any extension of credit is subject to credit approval by the lender in accordance with the terms contained in de nitive loan documents. Loans collateralized by securities involve certain risks and may not be suitable for all investors. Market conditions can magnify any potential for loss. If the market declines, you may be required to deposit additional securities and/or cash into your account. The securities in your account may be sold to meet a collateral/ maintenance call, and J.P. Morgan may sell your securities without contacting you. In exercising its remedies, J.P. Morgan will not be required to marshal assets or act in accordance with any duciary duty it otherwise might have. Some or all of the securities sold to meet a margin/maintenance call may be sold at prices higher than their initial cost, which may result in adverse tax consequences. You should consult your tax advisor in order to fully understand the tax implications associated with pledging securities in connection with a margin loan. Please read your client agreement carefully so that you understand your obligations.</p>
